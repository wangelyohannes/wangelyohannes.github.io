      <h2>Course Contract</h2>

      <p>
        I, Wangel Yohannes, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my
        Spring 2026, ITIS 3135, Front-End Web Application Development with my instructor,
        Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work that I do on publicly
        available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put
        information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep
        private. I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not
        logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show
        as absences. I also understand that given the structure and content of this class
        it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates' code
        directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut
        and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries)
        and never from my classmates.
      </p>
